## Getting Started

Make a `lib/firebase.ts` file where you put firebase configuration files and export `const app`

First, install the dev dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# or
yarn i
yarn dev
# or
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
